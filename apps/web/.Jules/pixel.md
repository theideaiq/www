## 2025-02-18 - [Empty State Consistency]
**Learning:** Empty states (like missing product images) were inconsistent, using raw text instead of design system tokens.
**Action:** Standardize empty states using `bg-white/5`, `text-slate-500`, and `lucide-react` icons (e.g., `ImageOff`) with `opacity-50` for visual hierarchy. Typography should use `uppercase tracking-widest` for labels.

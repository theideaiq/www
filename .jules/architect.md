## 2026-02-03 - [Test Co-location]
Smell: [Tests for shared packages located in consuming apps (e.g., `apps/web/src/lib/string-utils.test.ts` testing `@repo/utils`)]
Standard: [Unit tests must be co-located with the source code they test (e.g., `packages/utils/src/string.test.ts`). Packages must own their own test configuration.]

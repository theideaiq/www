## 2026-01-19 - Middleware Standardization
Structure: Next.js Middleware files must be named `middleware.ts` and reside in the `src/` directory.
Rule: Any file intended to run as Next.js middleware must strictly follow the `src/middleware.ts` naming convention to be recognized by the framework. Custom names like `proxy.ts` are forbidden for this purpose.
